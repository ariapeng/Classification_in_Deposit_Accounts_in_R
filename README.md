# Classification_in_Deposit_Accounts_in_R
A bank compiled customer information during a campaign to identify the cause for revenue decline,
which they concluded was caused by existing customers not obtaining long-term deposit accounts. In the
project, we attempt to identify which customers are likely to obtain long-term deposit accounts based
on customer information and demographics. Since the compiled data set mainly consists of categorical
predictors, we will focus on tree-based methodologies in this project.

For this project, we are going to be looking at a banking data set to try and predict the likelihood of a
customer obtaining a long-term deposit account based on their information and demographics. This data
set has a total of 32,950 observations within it. We are looking at the data set from a business perspective.
Meaning we are wanting to try a figure out which customers we have that are more likely to have a long-term
deposit account. We will be examining the data through various tree-based modeling techniques considering
a majority of predictor variables are categorical. Our analysis of data includes exploratory data analysis,
pre-processing, feature selection, modeling, and performance evaluation of five different tree-based model
types. These various techniques are what lead us to our conclusions.
