# Classification_in_Deposit_Accounts_in_R
A bank compiled customer information during a campaign to identify the cause for revenue decline,
which they concluded was caused by existing customers not obtaining long-term deposit accounts. In the
project, we attempt to identify which customers are likely to obtain long-term deposit accounts based
on customer information and demographics. Since the compiled data set mainly consists of categorical
predictors, we will focus on tree-based methodologies in this project.
